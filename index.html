If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, consult with your doctor or pharmacist before use. Dietary supplements and wellness products have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a dietary supplement. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any dietary supplement. While dietary supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you should check with doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your doctor or pharmacist first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users.

If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, consult with your doctor or pharmacist before use. Dietary supplements and wellness products have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a dietary supplement. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any dietary supplement. While dietary supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you should check with doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your doctor or pharmacist first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.Reversals and Chargebacks We reserve the right to file a complaint with the appropriate local and federal authorities to investigate.

If you are taking prescription drugs, or have a medical condition, consult with your doctor or pharmacist before use. Dietary supplements and wellness products have shown overwhelming evidence that they work. Just because a small amount works well does NOT mean that more is better. As individuals we all have different constitutions, sensitivities, allergic reactions and possible health conditions. Consult with your doctor or pharmacist on possible interactions and contraindications with prescription medicine. Always check with your doctor or pharmacist before using a dietary supplement. If you are pregnant, nursing a baby, or have a chronic medical condition, such as, diabetes, hypertension or heart disease, be sure to consult your doctor or pharmacist before purchasing or taking any dietary supplement. While dietary supplements are widely used and generally considered safe, you should check with doctor or pharmacist before taking these or any other dietary supplements. If you plan to use a dietary supplement in place of drugs or in combination with any drug, tell your doctor or pharmacist first. Many supplements contain active ingredients that have strong biological effects and their safety is not always assured in all users. If you have certain health conditions and take these products, you may be placing yourself at risk.Reversals and Chargebacks We reserve the right to file a complaint with the appropriate local and federal authorities to investigate.
